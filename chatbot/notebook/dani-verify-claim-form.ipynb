    "    **Validation Steps (Apply these rules strictly in order)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Procedure Consistency**: \n",
    "       Check if the procedures are clinically appropriate for the diagnosis.\n",
    "       - *Logic*: Use the relation from {golden_query_to_get_diagnose_and_procedure_relation} (replace '<diagnosis_id>' with '{form_input['diagnosa_id']}').\n",
    "       - *Guidance*: If the procedures are standard diagnostic tools for the diagnosis (e.g., CT Scan/MRI for Stroke), it is a MATCH.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Cost Analysis (The 20% Rule)**: \n",
    "       Compare the Form's Total Cost vs. Ground Truth (Sum of Diagnosis Avg Cost + Procedure Avg Costs).\n",
    "       - *Logic*: Calculate the deviation: `(Form_Cost - Ground_Truth) / Ground_Truth`.\n",
    "       - *Guidance*: \n",
    "          - If deviation is **< 20%**: Consider this **NORMAL** operational variance (e.g., room upgrades, extra meds). Do NOT flag as fraud based on cost alone.\n",
    "          - If deviation is **> 20%**: Flag as **FRAUD** (Cost significantly inflated).\n",
    "       - Use these queries to get ground truth:\n",
    "         * Diagnosis cost: {golden_query_get_diagnosis_cost} (replace '<diagnosis_id>' with '{form_input['diagnosa_id']}')\n",
    "         * Procedure costs: {golden_query_get_procedure_costs} (replace '<primary_procedure>' with '{form_input['primary_procedure']}' and '<secondary_procedure>' with '{form_input['secondary_procedure']}')\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Doctor Qualification (GP Exception)**: \n",
    "       Check if the doctor is qualified.\n",
    "       - *Logic*: Use {golden_query_get_specialisties_doctor} (replace '<doctor_id>' with '{form_input['doctor_id']}').\n",
    "       - *Guidance*: \n",
    "          - **GPs (General Practitioners)** are VALID for initial diagnoses, consultations, and ordering standard scans (like MRI/CT), even for complex conditions like Stroke. \n",
    "          - Flag as **FRAUD** only if there is a **hard contradiction** (e.g., a Pediatrician performing Major Surgery, or an Ophthalmologist treating Heart Attack).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Hospital Capability**: \n",
    "       Check if the hospital has relevant facilities.\n",
    "       - *Logic*: Use {golden_query_get_specialties_and_facilities_hospital} (replace '<hospital_id>' with '{form_input['hospital_id']}').\n",
    "       - *Guidance*: Look for broad keyword matches. For example, if Diagnosis is \"Stroke\", facilities like \"ICU\", \"Neurology\", or \"Internal Medicine\" are sufficient evidence of capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Final Verdict**:\n",
    "       Based on the above, determine FRAUD or NORMAL.\n",
    "       - Provide a confidence score (0-100%).\n",
    "       - Provide the Form Data Summary.\n",
    "       - **Explanation**: You MUST explicitly state the cost deviation percentage in your explanation (e.g., \"Cost is 4.5% higher, which is within the acceptable 20% variance\").\n",
